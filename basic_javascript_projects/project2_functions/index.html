Imagine sitting in a cell for years,<br>decades, or even for life, convicted of an activity that is no longer a crime, while thousands of other people build <br>intergenerational wealth doing exactly the same thing.That is the situation that over 40,000 cannabis prisoners face today in the <br>United States alone, while countless others languish in jails and prisons worldwide.</p>
